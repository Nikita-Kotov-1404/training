[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly]
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wrote a letter to myself
In the form of a song I can play when the Sun shines
I know better than to trust
Anything that I say to myself when I'm this high

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high
